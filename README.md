# Portfolio
- A simple portfolio built using only HTML and CSS.

## Techniques used
- Mobile first development
- Semantic elements
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flexbox

## Takeaways
- I learned there's a lot more to CSS than I realized
- I practiced more with media queries
- Actually learning Grid + Flexbox rather than just throwing stuff at the wall and hoping it sticks
